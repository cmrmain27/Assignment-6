# Assignment-6
This program is designed to find the shortest distance between 
cities. The algorithm may not actually for the best path for the shortest 
distance between all the cities because it is a greedy algorithm that 
only determines the shortest distance depending on the initial city 
(or city 0) instead of traversing all the cities to find the best path. 
It is designed to show the importance of Dijkstra's Algorithm.
